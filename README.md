# Satellite Imagery Segmentation 

Goal of this project is to segment the road networks from satellite captured images.<\br>

I have refered and copied some code which I felt usefull from 
https://towardsdatascience.com/road-detection-using-segmentation-models-and-albumentations-libraries-on-keras-d5434eaf73a8. 

* Download dataset from - https://www.kaggle.com/insaff/massachusetts-roads-dataset

* unzip the dataset into root directory.

* Download saved model checkpoints from - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-ntVfx7bju5hmuyvV_WkKnHwUS4et88b?usp=sharing 

* Best checkpoint - road_crop.10.h5

* download the model checkpoint file into root directory of the project.

Create conda environemt as follows to run the jupyter notebook project. 
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
